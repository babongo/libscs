code:
- minimal crypto implementation: aes + hmac + sha1 + rand
[stewy] bindings for common web scripting languages
- doxy framework
- length constraint over produced cookies
- factor out compression code

- on darwin with compression enabled I get:
==96275== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

- introduce refresh + expiry parameters explicitly into scs_t 

doc:
- s/(It can't be used when |S| > 1)/with an hint on using a sync/lazy querying 
  protocol in case |S| > 1 (sullivan@cs.vu.nl)
