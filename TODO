code:
- minimal crypto implementation: aes + hmac + sha1 + rand
[stewy] bindings for common web scripting languages
- doxy framework
- length constraint over produced cookies
- factor out compression code

- on darwin with compression enabled I get:
==96275== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

- check for possible all-empty attack on prev_keyset in case prev_keyset is
  not initialized

doc:
- s/(It can't be used when |S| > 1)/with an hint on using a sync/lazy querying 
  protocol in case |S| > 1 (sullivan@cs.vu.nl)
- check security considerations against: 
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpstate-cookie-23#section-8
- time based key update mechanism:
    given S = S1 || S2
    enc_key = HMAC_{S1}(foo(now, refresh_interval))
    auth_key = HMAC_{S2}(foo(now, refresh_interval))
