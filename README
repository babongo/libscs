SCS is a cryptographic protocol layered on top of the HTTP cookie
facility [I-D.ietf-httpstate-cookie], that allows an origin server to
handle clients' session state without storing it locally.

An SCS enabled server delegates the application state storage to the
client (e.g. a browser) - which basically acts as a remote storage
device.  A set of cryptographic transformations is used to ensure
that information authenticity and confidentiality attributes of state
data have the same characteristics as for typical "server-side"
sessions.
