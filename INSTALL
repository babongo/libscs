== Preconditions ==

LibSCS build is done with MaKL.  If you don't have MaKL on your platform, see
http://koanlogic.com/makl for the latest release and install it.

== Quick Installation ==

Basic build steps for LibSCS are:

  $ makl-conf         # extra ${CONF_ARGS} are optional
  $ makl

To install SCS on the local filesystem, as superuser run:

  # makl install

== Bindings ==

To build and install bindings enter the appropriate directory (e.g.
bindings/python) and run:

  $ makl
  # makl install

== Details ==

The default installation prefix is /usr/local. This value can be overridden by
adding --prefix=${INSTALL_PREFIX} to ${CONF_ARGS}.

To select which crypto library is used add --crypto=${CRIPTO_LIB} to
${CONF_ARGS}.  Currently supported values for ${CRYPTO_LIB} are "openssl" and
"cyassl".  If none is given, assume OpenSSL.

By default, dependencies will be sought for in /usr /usr/local. These values can
be overridden via --libs=${LIBS_INSTALL_DIR} for all libraries or
--lib-${LIB_NAME}=${LIB_INSTALL_DIR} for single libraries.

For more detail on configuration options run:

$ makl-conf --help
